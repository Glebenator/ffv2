- Expo CLI
- Expo Go app on your phone (for testing)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Glebenator/ffv2.git
cd ffv2
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash

### Development Notes

**Expo Go Compatibility**: The app is designed to work with Expo Go for easy development. Some features like gradient backgrounds have been implemented using standard React Native styling to maintain compatibility.

**For Custom Native Features**: If you need features like linear gradients, custom native modules, or Raspberry Pi Bluetooth integration, you'll need to create a development build:
```bash
eas build --profile development
```

## Design System
