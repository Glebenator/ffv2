# FridgeFriend v2 ðŸ¥—

A smart kitchen companion app that connects to a Raspberry Pi 5 to track your fridge inventory, manage ingredients, and suggest recipes based on what you have.

## Features

- **Smart Expiration Alerts**: Get notified before food expires
- **Recipe Suggestions**: Discover recipes based on available ingredients
- **Shopping Lists**: Automatic shopping list generation based on low stock
- **Category Management**: Organize items by categories (Vegetables, Dairy, Meat, etc.)

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React Native + Expo
- **Navigation**: Expo Router (file-based routing)
- **Styling**: React Native StyleSheet with custom design system
- **Backend Integration**: Raspberry Pi 5 (connection setup in progress)
- **Platform**: iOS & Android

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Expo CLI
- Expo Go app on your phone (for testing)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Glebenator/ffv2.git
cd ffv2
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
# or with tunnel for remote access
npm run start
```

4. Scan the QR code with:

### Development Notes

**Expo Go Compatibility**: The app is designed to work with Expo Go for easy development. Some features like gradient backgrounds have been implemented using standard React Native styling to maintain compatibility.

**For Custom Native Features**: If you need features like linear gradients, custom native modules, or Raspberry Pi Bluetooth integration, you'll need to create a development build:
```bash
eas build --profile development
```

## Design System

### Colors
- **Primary**: Mint Green (#10B981) - Fresh and healthy
- **Secondary**: Orange (#F59E0B) - Appetizing and energetic
